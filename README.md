# Key code snippets from analysis:

# Data Preparation
data['Order Date'] = pd.to_datetime(data['Order Date'])
data['Order Month'] = data['Order Date'].dt.month
data['Order Year'] = data['Order Date'].dt.year

# Yearly Sales Analysis
yearly_sales = data.groupby('Order Year')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()
px.bar(yearly_sales, x='Order Year', y='Sales', title='Yearly Sales Analysis')

# Category Analysis
sales_by_category = data.groupby('Category')['Sales'].sum().reset_index()
px.pie(sales_by_category, values='Sales', names='Category', 
       title='Sales Distribution by Category')

# Profit Analysis
profit_by_category = data.groupby('Category')['Profit'].sum().reset_index()
px.bar(profit_by_category, x='Category', y='Profit', 
       title='Category-wise Profit Analysis')

# Segment Analysis
sales_profit_by_segment = data.groupby('Segment').agg({'Profit':'sum', 'Sales':'sum'}).reset_index()
px.bar(sales_profit_by_segment, x='Segment', y=['Profit', 'Sales'],
       title='Sales and Profit by Segment', barmode='group')


## Conclusion
This comprehensive analysis reveals significant opportunities to optimize product mix, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts. The visualizations clearly highlight seasonal patterns, profitable product categories, and customer segment performance that can inform data-driven businessÂ decisions.
